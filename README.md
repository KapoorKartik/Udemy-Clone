### Summary
  Our project is to clone www.hubspot.com/ We did 10 pages Home page, Contact Sales, Book Meeting , Sign up & Login, Careers, Contact Us ,Investor Relations ,Management Team and Get started with Hubspot. We use the Font Awesome library for icons, Google Fonts library for fonts. To make it interactive with the user we use javascript language. We have also used some api in Investor Relations page to fetch dynamic data and also used localStorage property to store the users data for Login and scheduling the meeting. Thanks.
